## Project Description
The Smart Subscription Tracker is a data-driven project designed to help users and subscription-based businesses manage multiple services effectively. It predicts which subscriptions are likely to be canceled, estimates monthly spending, and segments users to uncover patterns in behavior. The project leverages machine learning models (logistic regression, linear regression, and K-Means clustering) along with data visualization and exploratory analysis to generate actionable insights. A Flask-based web tool allows users to interact with the models and receive predictions and recommendations in real time.
